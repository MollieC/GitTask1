//I created a person object, with attributes, constructors (to be used when I call the instance of the object in another class)
//and getters and setters as a means of encapsulation (as I've made the attributes private, they can only be accessed
//via getters and setters in public classes).
//I also added a status attribute, which, when called, will assign a person a status of Crew, Captain or Owner(until I do, they
//just need to be commented out.
//The array attribute was also added to help with assigning the boats to people. Because of this there is an ownBoat method
//included in this class which is called upon later. There are also getters and setters because of the fact that
//the ownership of the boat is a private attribute.
//In terms of the 'role' section- I was trying to assign roles to individuals, but I couldn't quite figure out how to 
//so I did it the only way I kind of knew how, but I know that I've created a whole different class and object, and thats
//definitely not how its meant to be done.
//I commented out the secondName section because I couldn't figure out how to split the first name and the second name when parsing the people from the text file.
